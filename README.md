# weatherApp
In this project, we will use openweather API which provides us free API to get weather details. Here we will add an input field where user will add any city name and as soon city name gets entered an API call will occur and details will be fetched to the screen. This App completely depends on API.  visit https://portfoliosagar777.netlify.app/
