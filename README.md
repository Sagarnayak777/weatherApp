# weatherApp

In this project, we will use openweather API which provides us free API to get weather details. Here we will add an input field where user will add any city name and as soon city name gets entered an API call will occur and details will be fetched to the screen. This App completely depends on API.  
the language used in JavaScript and HTML, like JavaScript Objects, functions, If statements, ... etc

Let's talk about the application we are going to build; our weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API , an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value in Celsius unit, the weather description such as humidity, wind speed and then the user's city.
